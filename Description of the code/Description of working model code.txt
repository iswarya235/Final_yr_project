-> Run and upload the arduino code (final) after connecting the system with the mentioned wifi in the code
-> Open command prompt and move to the file destination 
     [cd "file location"]
-> Run the training code for each algorithm to know how accurate they work
     [python filename.py]
-> You'll be getting the accuracies of each algorithm 
-> Run the final code which has face recognition and the most accurate algorithm found is coded in it
     [python esp_python.py]
-> You'll get the final working result
